# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

I tried to continue defining the flow of my story. Much of this didn't change from a large-scale point of view; sections generally remained the same. However, I changed up some ordering and moved some visualizations around to try and refine the story, particularly in terms of questions that might logically arise from one data set or visualization.

I also tried to refine the page a bit to make it more visually appealing, particularly through the use of color and images. I wanted to make it feel less text heavy by breaking things up with images. I also thought the color could tie together certain sections and create some variety, rather than huge sections of a dark background.

Finally, and perhaps most obviously, I finished uploading my visualizations on Tableau Public and embedded them into my Shorthand story. This was a good way for me to learn a bit about some of the behind the scenes aspects, especially with formatting in Shorthand. It also helped me to define the visual elements of my story and see how the Shorthand page could continue themes.

## The audience

I wrestled with framing the audience as Broadway producers versus frequent attendees/theatre fans. I ultimately decided that targeting producers made more sense since they are able to effect change. This helped me refine the call to action to be more actionable, rather than something vague like "support theater." Rather, focusing on producers would allow me to shape the call to action to be more specific and measurable. I don't have connections to producers to directly interview them, but in showing my page to more people, they expressed that it would be logical to have producers be the target receivers of the messaging.

## Final design decisions

I think I came into the class thinking about it as primarily focused on data visualization. While that is certainly true, I think what was really impactful for me was thinking about the visualizations AND how the story connects them all. I thought the narrative portion of my page would be really easy to write, but it took some time to decide how the story should flow and how the data could support it. I found it helpful to break things into sections and make them really clear, which my interviewees said they appreciated. It all relates to the central issue, but introduces new ideas and concepts in a staggered manner. I found the storyboarding to be really beneficial for mapping things out and seeing how it all fits into the bigger picture.

# Final thoughts

I found this project to be a really cool way to look at data sets and identify a story! I wish I had been more intentional about setting the audience earlier on in the process, as I think this would have helped me focus the messaging quicker (and potentially find new data sets or aspects of the story to tell). I also would have loved to find data that could be represented in perhaps more diverse ways; I felt like my visualizations became a bit similar in terms of construction. I think I chose charts that got to the core of the messaging quickly, but I would have loved to include some different elements (a map, timeline, etc). Overall, I really enjoyed the project and definitely learned a lot about pulling the story together!
