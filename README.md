# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi! My name is Nick Helms and I use he/him pronouns. I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. Most of my work is in theatre, particularly in development. After graduating, I'm hoping to find a job in fundraising or grantmaking for the arts!

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn more about effective ways to use data in my workplace. I feel that many arts organizations don't utilize data as much as they could, so I'm hoping to find strategies I can bring to an organization that might not have much of an existing practice. Particularly in relation to fundraising for theatre and the arts, I see many ways this can take shape. Here are a few:

1. Crafting grant narratives that show impact, therefore minimizing giant blocks of text (and meeting word limits!)
2. Engaging with audiences and funders to show how the organization is supporting the community and what it does to further its mission
3. Streamlining the messaging that a marketing team might use with what the development office shares with donors and funders (building a brand identity)
