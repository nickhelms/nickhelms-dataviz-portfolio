# User research 

## Target audience

Ultimately, I think the story would best be targeted to Broadway producers. Since that is a pretty niche audience to which I am not connected, I decided to frame my target audience as Broadway theatergoers. I think it is important for people to know how the market for tickets has changed over time, particularly as they decide where to spend their money. To sample this audience, I shared my work with fellow Arts Management students at Heinz College who work in theatre and might be interested in learning more about the changes in ticket prices.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|I want to learn how people perceive the intention behind the story.      | What is the purpose of this piece?                 |
|I am curious how the interviewees think this is being framed in a larger context.      | Who do you think is the intended audience?                 |
|I want to ensure that the story is clear and ordered in a concise yet effective manner.      | Does the flow of information make sense? Would you rearrange anything?                 |
|The story needs to be comprehensive enough to answer all pressing questions, but still leave room for further exploration.      | Is there anything you would like to learn more about that isn’t included?                 |

Overall, I want to see how people receive the story and if it feels logical to them. Particularly regarding the comparison between wages and ticket prices, I think it's important to make sure that the visualizations and narrative don't get too complex. I want people to understand the key ideas and then dig deeper for more info if they are curious.

## Interview findings

The interviews were very productive in terms of identifying what is working well and what needs to be refined further.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (theatre worker) | Interview 2 (avid theatregoer) | Interview 3 (arts worker, but not specific to theatre) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is the purpose of this piece?  | To educate about the changes in Broadway ticket prices            | To show that theatre hasn't kept up with the speed of inflation            |To compare economic changes in the workforce to pricing changes in theatre             |
|Who do you think is the intended audience?                         | Broadway audiences                               |Broadway producers             |Anyone with an interest in theatre             |
|Does the flow of information make sense? Would you rearrange anything?                         | Yes, it's organized well and tells a clear story.                               |The transition cards help clarify what section is coming up next. I wouldn't make any changes.             | Perhaps tie the pricing and wages together into one larger section.            |
|Is there anything you would like to learn more about that isn’t included?                         |I would love to know if this is similar in theatres beyond Broadway.                                |I want to know if there is a major difference between specific Broadway shows' ticket prices.             |I'm curious how this contrasts with other artistic mediums (music, dance, etc).             |

# Identified changes for Part III 

I think continuing to refine the story will be critical to success for Part III. Making sure that all the relevant information is incuded and presented in a logical way is key. I also want to aim for consistency in my visualizations and ensure that I present a clear visual message.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interviews | A clear and consistent color palette would be helpful. |
| Interviews                                         | More of a multimedia experience would be fun (incorporating more than just text and visualizations).                                                                                |
|Interviews                                          | Different functionalities might make the piece more compelling (more than just text blocks and pictures).                                                                                |

I definitely agree with the findings from my interviews. I was glad to hear that they found the organization to be well-designed and easy to follow. I also appreciated that they called out the ease of identifying sections with the transition photos. I see ways that I can continue to improve the story by adding more variance in terms of content. I also think maintaining consistency in the colors and visual elements will make the entire story more cohesive. I see a clear path toward the final product and am grateful for the feedback I have received so far!
